**Team 9: Munir Bshara, Carrie Lei, Eric Zhong**  
**EE 459 Spring 2024 Capstone Project**

This repository contains all of the working source files for the SummitWand project,  a smart hiking stick for enhancing the outdoor hiking experience. Use the following instructions to compile and run the project...
* Install the GNU compiler collection for the C programming language
* Install the avr-gcc toolchain for the Atmega328p microcontroller
* Adjust the "PROGRAMMER" line at the top of the Makefile as necessary to match the target port and device used to program the microcontroller
* Type "make flash" to compile the project dependencies and flash them onto the microcontroller
* Typing "make clean" will remove all of the object files on the local machine
